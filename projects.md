Here is a few projects that I have done during my school years.

## BlackJack
- A card game made in Java as a project during my early years at Westminster College
- It plays Blackjack.  The only limitation it has is it cannot play for a long time.

## Encryption/Dectryption
- This program is made in Java during my time at Westminster College.
- It is designed to encrypt/encrypt files using RSA algorithms and a user-inputted key.
- This was a tricky, yet, fulfilling program I had to put together.

## Mr. Swordy
- A prototype game made in Java for my final project at Westminster College.
- This prototype is an ambitious solo attempt in designing/programming an action platformer game.
- The game is about a knight that can throw an infinite number of swords in his venture to save a kingdom from a dragon.

- A basic program I made in Python during my time at Salt Lake Community College
- It is designed to play out tic-tac-toe in the console.
